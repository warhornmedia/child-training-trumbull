<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> 1. Child-Training: What is it?</h1>
<p>The term “training,” like the term “teaching,” is used in various senses; hence it is Hable to be differently understood by different persons, when applied to a single department of a parent’s duties in the bringing up of his children. Indeed, the terms “training” and “teaching” are often used interchangeably, as covering the entire process of a child’s education. In this sense a child’s train- ing is understood to include his teaching; and, again, his teaching is understood to include his training. But in its more restricted sense the training of a child is the shaping, the developing, and the controlling of his personal faculties and powers ; while the teaching of a child is the secur- ing to him of knowledge from beyond himself.</p>
<p>It has been said that the essence of teaching is causing another to know. It may similarly be said that the essence of training is causing another to do. Teaching gives knowledge. Training gives skill. Teaching fills the mind. Training shapes the habits. Teaching brings to the child that which he did not have before. Training enables a child to make use of that w^iich is already his possession. We teach a child the meaning of words. We train a child in speaking and walk- ing. We teach him the truths which we have learned for ourselves. We train him in habits of study, that he may be able to learn other truths for himself Training and teaching must go on together in the wise upbringing of any and every child. The one will fail of its own best end if it be not accompanied by the other. He who knows how to teach a child, is not competent for the over- sight of a child’s education unless he also knows how to train a child.</p>
<p>Training is a possibility long before teaching is. Before a child is old enough to know what is said to it, it is capable of feeling, and of conforming to, or of resisting, the pressure of efforts for its train- ing. A child can be trained to go to sleep in the arms of its mother or nurse, or in a cradle, or on a bed ; with rocking, or without it ; in a light room, or in a dark one; in a noisy room, or only in a quiet one ; to expect nourishment and to accept it only at fixed hours, or at its own fancy, — while as yet it cannot understand any teaching concerning the importance or the fitness of one of these things. A very young child can be trained to cry for what it wants, or to keep quiet, as a means of securing it. And, as a matter of fact, the training of chil- dren is begun much earlier than their teaching. Many a child is well started in its life-training by the time it is six weeks old; even though its elementary teaching is not attempted until months after that.</p>
<p>There is a lesson just at this point in the signifi- cation of the Hebrew word translated “train” in our English Bible. It is a noteworthy fact, that this word occurs only twice in the Old Testament, and it has no equivalent in the New. Those who were brought up in the household of Abraham, " the father of the faithful," are said to have been “trained” (Gen. 14: 14). A proverb of the ages gives emphasis to a parent’s duty to “train up” his child with wise considerateness (Prov. 22 : 6). And nowhere else in the inspired record does the original of this word " train," in any of its forms, appear.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word thus translated is a peculiar one. Its etymology shows that its primary mean- ing is " to rub the gullet ;" and its origin seems to have been in the habit, still prevalent among primi- tive peoples, of opening the throat of a new-born babe by the anointing of it with blood, or with saliva, or with some sacred liquid, as a means of giving the child a start in life by the help of another’s life. The idea of the Hebrew word thus used seems to be that, as this opening of the gullet of a child at its very birth is essential to the habitu- ating of the child to breathe and to swallow cor- rectly, so the right training of a child in all proper habits of life is to begin at the child’s very birth. And the use of the word in the places where we find it, would go to show that Abraham with all his faith, and Solomon with all his wisdom, did not feel that it would be safe to put off the start with a child’s training any later than this.</p>
<p>Child-training properly begins at a child’s birth, but it does not properly end there. The first effort in the direction of child-training is to train a child to breathe and to swallow ; but that ought not to be the last effort in the same direction. Child-train- ing goes on as long as a child is a child ; and child-training covers every phase of a child’s action and bearing in life. Child-training affects a child’s sleeping and waking, his laughing and crying, his eating and drinking, his looks and his movements, his self-control and his conduct toward others. Child-training does not change a child’s nature, but it does change his modes of giving expression to his nature. Child-training does not give a child entirely new characteristics, but it brings him to the repression and subdual of certain character- istics, and to the expression and development of certain others, to such an extent that the sum of his characteristics presents an aspect so different from its original exhibit that it seems like another character. And so it is that child-training is, in a sense, like the very making of a child anew.</p>
<p>Child-training includes the directing and con- trolling and shaping of a child’s feelings and thoughts and words and ways in every sphere of his life-course, from his birth to the close of his childhood. And that this is no unimportant part of a child’s upbringing, no intelligent mind will venture to question.</p>

<!--- make it so en dashes never break, ORIGINAL script using .nobreak CSS span::: problem: breaks popup functionality of refTagger, even though the RegEx avoids messing with any refTagger refs; problem is with the script targeting any element which includes the refTagger, even if the RegEx avoids doing anything to the refTagger link HTML itself. It does not seem possible to use selectors to select everything but avoid selecting <a> tags with class "rtBibleRef". Problem is that if you select the <p> which has the link in it, you can't avoid selecting the <a> inside it. Script doesn't break reftagger if it is loaded on document.ready. Solution seems to be to find a way to use document.ready and somehow avoid Scripture ref en dashes. Maybe borrow reftagger's bible book regex, but that seems hopeless, esp. since I don't believe there's general browser support for negative lookbehind RegEx...
