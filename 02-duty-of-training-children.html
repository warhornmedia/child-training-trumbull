<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> 2. The Duty of Training Children</h1>
<p>It is the mistake of many parents to suppose that their chief duty is in loving and counseHng their children, rather than in loving and training them ; that they are faithfully to show their chil- dren what they ought to do, rather than to make them do it. The training power of the parent is, as a rule, sadly undervalued.</p>
<p>Too many parents seem to take it for granted that because their children are by nature very timid and retiring, or very bold and forward ; very extravagant in speech and manner, or quite disin- clined to express even a dutiful sense of gratitude and trust ; reckless in their generosity, or pitiably selfish ; disposed to overstudy, or given wholly to play; one-sided in this, or in that, or in the other, trait or quality or characteristic,—therefore those children must remain so; unless, indeed, they outgrow their faults, or are induced by wise counsel and loving entreaty to overcome them.</p>
<p>“My boy is irrepressible,” says one father. “He is full of dash and spirits. He makes havoc in the house while at home ; and when he goes out to a neighbor’s he either has things his own way, or he doesn’t want to go there again. I really wish he had a quieter nature ; but, of course, I can’t change him. I have given him a great many talks about this ; and I hope he will outgrow the worst of it. Still he is just what he is, and punishing him wouldn’t make him anybody else.” A good mother, on the other hand, is exercised because her little son is so bashful that he is always morti- fying her before strangers. He will put his finger in his mouth, and hang down his head, and twist one foot over the other, and refuse to shake hands, or to answer the visitor’s " H^ow do you do, my boy?" or even to say, " I thank you," with distinct- ness, when anything is given to him. And the same trouble is found with the tastes as with the temperaments of children. One is always ready to hear stories read or told, but wall not sit quiet and look at pictures, or use a slate and pencil. Another, a little older, will devour books of travel or adventure, but has no patience with a simple story of home life, or a book of instruction in matters of practical fact.</p>
<p>Now it is quite inevitable that children should have these peculiarities ; but it is not inevitable that they should continue to exhibit them offensively. Children can be trained in almost any direction. Their natural tendencies may be so curbed and guided as no longer to show themselves in disagree- able prominence. It is a parent’s privilege, and it is a parent’s duty, to make his children, by God’s blessing, to be and to do what they should be and do, rather than what they would like to be and do. If indeed this were not so, a parent’s mission would be sadly limited in scope, and diminished in impor- tance and preciousness. The parent who does not recognize the possibility of training his children as well as instructing them, misses one of his highest privileges as a parent, and fails of his most impor- tant work for his children.</p>
<p>The skilled physician in charge of a certain institution for the treatment of feeble-minded and imperfectly developed children, has said, that some children who are brought to him are lacking in just one important trait or quality, while they pos- sess a fair measure of every other. Or it may be said, that they have an excess of the trait or quality opposite to that which they lack.</p>
<p>One girl, for example, will be wholly without a sense of honesty; will even be possessed with a love of stealing for stealing’s sake, carrying it to such an extent that when seated at the table she will snatch a ball of butter from a plate, and wrap it up in a fold of her dress. If she should be unchecked in this propensity until she were a grown woman, she might prove one of the fashionable ladies who take books or dry goods from the stores where they are shopping, under the influence of " kleptomania."</p>
<p>Again, a boy has no sense of truth. He will tell lies without any apparent temptation to do so, even against his own obvious interests. All of us have seen persons of this sort in mature life. Some of them are to-day in places of prominence in Chris- tian work and influence. Yet another child is without any sense of reverence, or of modesty, or of natural affection. One lacks all control of his temper, another of his nerves. And so on in great variety.</p>
<p>The physician of that institution is by no means in despair over any of these cases. It is his mission to find out the child’s special lack, and to meet it ; to learn what traits are in excess, and to curb them ; to know the child’s needs, and to train him accordingly.</p>
<p>Every child is in a sense a partially developed, an imperfectly formed child. There are no abso- lutely perfect children in this world. All of them need restraining in some things and stimulating in others. And every imperfect child can be helped toward a symmetrical character by wise Christian training. Every home should be an institution for the treatment of imperfectly developed children. Every father and every mother should be a skilled physician in charge of such an institution. There are glorious possibilities in this direction j and there are weighty responsibilities also.</p>

<!--- make it so en dashes never break, ORIGINAL script using .nobreak CSS span::: problem: breaks popup functionality of refTagger, even though the RegEx avoids messing with any refTagger refs; problem is with the script targeting any element which includes the refTagger, even if the RegEx avoids doing anything to the refTagger link HTML itself. It does not seem possible to use selectors to select everything but avoid selecting <a> tags with class "rtBibleRef". Problem is that if you select the <p> which has the link in it, you can't avoid selecting the <a> inside it. Script doesn't break reftagger if it is loaded on document.ready. Solution seems to be to find a way to use document.ready and somehow avoid Scripture ref en dashes. Maybe borrow reftagger's bible book regex, but that seems hopeless, esp. since I don't believe there's general browser support for negative lookbehind RegEx...
