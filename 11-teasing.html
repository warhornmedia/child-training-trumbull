<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 12</span> 11. Training A Child Not To Tease</h1>
<p>A child who never “teases” is a rarity; yet no child ought to tease. If a child does tease, the blame of his teasing properly rests on his parents, rather than on himself The parent who realizes this fact, will have an added stimulus to the work of training his child not to tease ; and no phase of the work of child-training is simpler, or surer of its result, than this one.</p>
<p>“To tease” is “to pull,” “to tug,” “to drag,” “to vex [or carry] with importunity,” A child teases when he wants something from his parents, and fails to get it at the first asking. He pulls and tugs at his parents, in the hope of dragging them to his way of thinking, or to a consent to his hav- ing what he wants in spite of their different think- ing. He hope? to vex or carry them into the line</p>
<p>lOl</p>
<p>102 HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING.</p>
<p>of his desires by means of his importunities, what- ever their view of the case may have been, to begin with. If a child could have what he wanted at his first asking, he would not tease; for there would be no room for his teasing. If a child never secured anything through teasing, he would not come into the habit of teasing ; for there would be no induce- ment to him to tease. When, therefore, a child is accustomed to tease, it is evident that he has been trained by his parents to tease, instead of being trained by them not to tease; and they are to bear the responsibility and blame of his teasing.</p>
<p>Many a child does not expect to get what he wants, if it is out of the ordinary line of his daily needs, unless he teases for it; therefore he counts teasing a part of his regular duty in life, as truly as “beating down” the city shop-keeper on his prices is supposed to be the duty of a shopper from the country. If a child asks for a slice of bread-and- butter, or a bit of meat, at the family table, or for a glass of water between meals, he expects to get it at the first asking. Teasing for that is not in his</p>
<p>HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING. 103</p>
<p>mind as a necessity. But if he wants to stay at home from school without any reason for it, or to start off witli some of his schoolmates on a long and hazardous tramp on a Saturday, or to sit up an hour later than usual at night, or to have a new sled or velocipede or bicycle, or to go to the circus or to hear the minstrels, “like all the other fel- lows,” — he is not so sure of gaining his request at the first asking. So, when the answer “No” comes back to him, in such a case, he meets it with the appeal, " Do let me. Oh, do ! " and then he enters upon a nerve struggle for the mastery over his parents at this point, with the idea in his mind that it is a single question of who shall be most persistent in adhering to his side of the conflict.</p>
<p>There are few children who always succeed in carrying their point by teasing; but there are fewer who never succeed by this means. Most parents give way, sooner or later, in some of these conflicts with their children. It miay be that they are less determined than their children,</p>
<p>I04 HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>and that they are simply tired out by the teasing. It may be that they are moved by their children’s earnestness in the matter, and that they yield be- cause of their tenderness toward the little pleaders. It may be that their first answer to the appeal is a thoughtless one, and that their fuller considering of the matter leads theni to see it to be right to reverse their impulsive decision. Whatever be the parents’ reason for their course in such a case, if they give a negative answer to their children’s first request, and an affirmative one in response to more or less teasing on the children’s part, they train their children so far to believe that teasing is an important factor in a child’s progress in life; and of course they are responsible for their children’s continuance in the habit of teasing.</p>
<p>It is a misfortune to a child to suppose that teas- ing is essential to his gaining a point that he ought to gain. A result of such a view in his mind is, that he l^oks not to his parents’ wisdom and judg- ment, but to his own positiveness and persistency, as the guide of his action In any mooted case of</p>
<p>HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING. 105</p>
<p>personal conduct; not to principles which are dis- closed to him by one who is in authority, but to impulses which are wholly in his own bosom. Such a view is inimical to all wise methods of thinking and doing on a child’s part. And it is even more of a misfortune to the parent than to the child, for a child to have the idea that the parent’s decision is a result of the child’s teasing, rather than of the parent’s understanding of what is right and best in a given case. No parent can have the truest respect of a child, while the child knows that he can tease that parent into compli- ance with the child’s request, contrary to the par- ent’s real or supposed conviction. For the child’s sake, therefore, and also for the parent’s, every child ought to be trained not to tease, and not to expect any possible advantage from teasing.</p>
<p>Susannah Wesley, the mother of John and Charles Wesley, was accustomed to say, of her children, that they all learned very early that they were not to have anything that they cried for, and that so they soon learned not to cry for a thing</p>
<p>I06 HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING.</p>
<p>that they wanted. Who will doubt that John and Charles Wesley were stronger men, for this training, than they could have been if they were trained to look upon crying as a means of securing what was best for them ? Who will doubt that Susannah Wesley was more of a woman, and more respected by her sons because of her unvarying firmness at this point, than would have been possi- ble if she had frequently yielded to the pressure of their piteous crying for that which it was against her judgment to give to them? Any parent who would apply this rule of Susannah Wesley to the matter of teasing, might be sure of a corresponding result in the children’s estimate of the practical value of teasing. Any child who finds that he is never to have anything for which he teases, will quickly quit teasing. How simple this rule, for this department of child-training!</p>
<p>Simple as it seems, however, to be uniformly positive in refusing to give to a child anything for which he teases, it is not an easy thing to adhere to this rule, unvaryingly, and to do it wisely. And</p>
<p>HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING. lO</p>
<p>the trouble in the case is not with the child, but with the parent. In order to give promptly, to a child’s request, an answer that can rightly be in- sisted upon against all entreaties, a parent must do his thinking before he gives that answer, rather than afterwards. Too often a parent denies a child’s request at the start without considering the case in all its bearings; and then, when the child presses his suit, the parent sees reasons for granting it which had not been in his mind be- fore. The child perceives this state of things, and realizes that the question is to be settled by his teasing, rather than by his parent’s independent judgment; and that, therefore, teasing is the only means of securing a correct decision in the premises. Training a child not to tease, is a duty incumbent upon every parent ; but, as a prerequisite to this training of the child, the parent must himself be trained. When a child asks a favor of a parent, the parent must not reply hastily, or thoughtlessly, or without a full understanding of the case in all its involvings. If necessary, he may question the</p>
<p>I08 HINTS ON CHILD-TRAINING, ,</p>
<p>child, in order to a better understanding of the case, or he may postpone his answer until he can learn more about it; but he must not be over quick to reply merely as a means of pushing away the request for the time being. He must consider carefully what his final answer ought to be, before he gives an answer that the child is to accept as final ; and when the parent gives that answer, it ought to be with such kindly firmness that the child will not think of pressing his suit by teasing. And thus it is that any well-trained parent can train his child well in this sphere.</p>

<!--- make it so en dashes never break, ORIGINAL script using .nobreak CSS span::: problem: breaks popup functionality of refTagger, even though the RegEx avoids messing with any refTagger refs; problem is with the script targeting any element which includes the refTagger, even if the RegEx avoids doing anything to the refTagger link HTML itself. It does not seem possible to use selectors to select everything but avoid selecting <a> tags with class "rtBibleRef". Problem is that if you select the <p> which has the link in it, you can't avoid selecting the <a> inside it. Script doesn't break reftagger if it is loaded on document.ready. Solution seems to be to find a way to use document.ready and somehow avoid Scripture ref en dashes. Maybe borrow reftagger's bible book regex, but that seems hopeless, esp. since I don't believe there's general browser support for negative lookbehind RegEx...
